-- /Example/:
--
-- Connect to a server, declare a queue and an exchange and setup a callback for messages coming in on the queue. Then publish a single message to our new exchange

-- /Exception handling/:
--
-- Some function calls can make the AMQP server throw an AMQP exception, which has the side-effect of closing the connection or channel. The AMQP exceptions are raised as Haskell exceptions (see 'AMQPException'). So upon receiving an 'AMQPException' you may have to reopen the channel or connection.
